# Homebrew formula for the Wire CLI (experimental, wire#408).
#
# Lives in the public rittmananalytics/wire-plugin repository as Formula/wire.rb
# is the source of truth, published by the release step with the version and
# sha256 filled in. Install with:
#
#   brew tap rittmananalytics/wire https://github.com/rittmananalytics/wire-plugin
#   brew install wire
#
# The formula installs the packaged CLI and framework under libexec, a Python
# virtualenv with PyYAML (the resolver's one dependency), and the `wire`
# launcher, and on a Mac the standalone agent (wire-agent). It does not
# install OpenAI's codex or Claude Code; `wire doctor` says which are present.

      Wire runs its steps through an agent harness: the bundled wire-agent on
      a Mac, or one you install:
        codex   npm install -g @openai/codex
        claude  https://claude.com/claude-code
      Keys go in ~/.wire/secrets.env (see wire/cli/README.md). Run `wire doctor`.
