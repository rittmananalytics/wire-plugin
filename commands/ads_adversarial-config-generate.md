# Configure and test adversarial review sub-agent

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true
---

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'ads_adversarial-config-generate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

## Automatic Validation (on by default)

---
description: Internal utility — injected auto-validate section so generate commands run their matching validate step automatically and fold the result into their output
---

Every `generate` command that has a matching `validate` command for the
same artifact runs that validate step automatically as part of generate —
by default, with no separate command to remember. This section only appears
on commands where that applies; artifacts with no separate validate step at
all (e.g. mockups, workshops, UAT) never carry this section.

## Step: Check `auto_validate`

Read this command's own `auto_validate` front-matter field, in the Workflow
Specification below. Two states:

- **Absent, or `true`** (the default — most artifacts): auto-validate runs.
- **`false`**: this artifact's validate step is expensive — it runs real
  code, queries a live warehouse or BI tool, or otherwise does IO beyond
  re-reading local files — so it does not run automatically. Skip to
  "If `auto_validate: false`" below.

## If `auto_validate` is absent or `true`: run validate automatically

Once this command finishes writing its artifact, before ending:

1. Run this artifact's own `/wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate` workflow
   in full, exactly as if the consultant had typed it themselves — same
   inputs, same `status.md` write to `artifacts.<artifact>.validate`, same
   report. This is not optional or an extra step layered on top; it is the
   default behavior for this artifact.
2. Fold the result into this command's own closing output rather than
   presenting it as a separate command run:
   - **PASS** — add a single closing line: `✅ Auto-validated — PASS`. The
     full report already went to `status.md`/`execution_log.md`, exactly as
     it would from a standalone validate run — no need to repeat it here.
   - **FAIL** — surface the validate command's own failure report in full,
     exactly as running validate standalone would show it, so the
     consultant sees what's wrong immediately without running anything
     else themselves.
3. This never blocks or undoes generate itself — the artifact is written
   either way, and its content is never rolled back because validate
   failed. Auto-validation only means validate has already run and its
   result is already on record by the time generate finishes, instead of
   waiting for the consultant to remember to run it separately.

## If `auto_validate` is `false`: state this plainly, don't run it

Do not run validate. End with a line naming why, as specifically as this
spec's own context makes possible (e.g. "runs `dbt run`/`dbt test`",
"queries the live target warehouse", "calls the Looker API directly") —
fall back to "performs live checks against an external system" only if no
more specific reason is evident from context:

```
⚠ This artifact's validate step [reason] and does not run automatically.
Run /wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate <release_folder> before
requesting review — review is blocked until it passes.
```

## Why this is always safe either way

`review` already requires `validate: PASS` for this same artifact as one of
its own declared preconditions (see `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md`) —
this is existing, independent enforcement, not something added by this
section. So an `auto_validate: false` opt-out never lets an artifact reach
review unvalidated; it only decides *when* the consultant pays validate's
cost — automatically on every draft (the default), or once, on their own
schedule, before requesting review (the opt-out). Auto-validation is a
convenience that closes the "forgot to run it" gap for the common case; the
gate that actually prevents unvalidated work from being reviewed was already
there.

# Agentic Data Stack — Adversarial Config Generate

Follow `specs/utils/agentic_data_stack_delegate.md` before executing the workflow below.

## Purpose

Configure, calibrate, and test the adversarial review sub-agent — the Claude instance that challenges every answer before it reaches the user. Anthropic measured a 6% accuracy gain from this step (at 32% higher token cost and 72% higher latency). This command documents the trade-off for the client and configures it to their latency and cost tolerance.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:ads_adversarial-config-generate YYYYMMDD_client_agentic_data_stack
```

## Prerequisites

- `agent_config.review: approved`
- `eval_suite.generate: complete`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Discuss the Trade-off

Present the trade-off to the consultant and note the client's decision:

```
## Adversarial Review — Configuration Decision

Based on Anthropic's measured results on their own analytics platform:

| Configuration | Accuracy gain | Token cost increase | Latency increase |
|---|---|---|---|
| With adversarial review | +6% | +32% | +72% |
| Without adversarial review | baseline | baseline | baseline |

At your current query volume:
- Estimated additional cost per month: £[X] (at current pricing)
- Estimated latency impact: queries take ~8–15s instead of ~5–8s

Recommended for: dashboards, async reports, any query going to leadership
Not recommended for: high-volume live chat interfaces with latency SLAs

**Recommended configuration:** Adversarial review ON for all queries (default)
```

Record the client's decision in status.md.

### Step 2: Configure Adversarial Review Prompt

The adversarial review is already embedded in the agentic data stack SKILL.md (Step 5 of agent_config/generate.md). If the client chose a standalone adversarial reviewer (separate agent call), configure it here:

```markdown
# Adversarial Reviewer System Prompt

You are the adversarial reviewer for the [client] agentic data stack. Your job is to 
challenge every answer the agentic data stack provides before it reaches the user.

You receive: the original question + the agent's proposed answer + the SQL or metric 
query used.

Systematically check:

1. **Source**: Is the answer from the correct canonical table? Would a different table 
   give a different result?

2. **Filter**: Are the WHERE clauses correct for the question? Revenue questions must 
   exclude returns and cancelled orders. Verify the filter matches the canonical 
   definition in DOMAIN_REFERENCE.md.

3. **Grain**: Is the result at the right granularity? If the question asked for monthly 
   and the answer is daily, flag it.

4. **Plausibility**: Does the number make sense? Apply these sanity checks:
   - Revenue per day should be £X–£Y (ask domain owner to set bounds)
   - Order count per day should be N–M
   - Customer count should be less than total registered users
   
5. **Definition**: Does the metric definition match what the question asked? 
   "Active customers" may differ from "all customers".

If all checks pass: respond "APPROVED — no issues found."
If any check fails: respond "REVISION REQUIRED — [specific issue]" and provide 
the corrected query or answer.

Never approve an answer you suspect is wrong, even partially.
```

### Step 3: Run Calibration Tests

Run 5 adversarial calibration tests — questions where the naive answer would be wrong and the adversarial check should catch it:

| Test | Naive answer | Expected adversarial catch |
|---|---|---|
| "Revenue last month" against wrong table | Returns gross not net | Filter check catches wrong revenue definition |
| "Active customers" without time filter | Returns all customers | Filter check catches missing 30-day window |
| "Orders this week" with daily grain | Returns daily rows | Grain check catches wrong aggregation |

Record which checks fired and whether corrections were accurate.

### Step 4: Set Production Configuration

In `agentic-data-stack-SKILL.md`, confirm the adversarial review section is active. For standalone configuration:

```yaml
# agent_config.yaml
adversarial_review:
  enabled: true
  mode: inline  # inline (built into main agent) | standalone (separate agent call)
  checks:
    - source
    - filter
    - grain
    - plausibility
    - definition
  plausibility_bounds:
    daily_revenue_min: 10000
    daily_revenue_max: 500000
    daily_orders_min: 50
    daily_orders_max: 5000
```

### Step 5: Update Status

```yaml
adversarial_config:
  generate: complete
  generated_date: YYYY-MM-DD
  mode: inline
  client_decision: enabled
  calibration_tests: 5
  calibration_pass_rate: 100%
```

### Step 6: Sync to Document Store (Optional)

If a document store is configured for this project, follow the workflow in `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`:
- `artifact_id`: `adversarial_config`
- `artifact_name`: `Adversarial Config`
- `file_path`: `.wire/[release_folder]/artifacts/adversarial_calibration_results.md`
- `project_id`: the release folder path

If docstore sync fails, log the error and continue — do not block the generate command.

## Output

- Updated `agentic-data-stack-SKILL.md` (adversarial section confirmed)
- `.wire/<release-folder>/artifacts/adversarial_config.yaml`
- `.wire/<release-folder>/artifacts/adversarial_calibration_results.md`
- Updated `status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail | By | Session | Duration | Tokens | Cost (USD) |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|----|---------|----------|--------|------------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> | <by> | <session> | <duration> | n/a | n/a |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition, or an advisory gate satisfied by a director's ruling
  - `mode` — the director handed control over or took it back ("you drive" / "I'll drive"), per `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason
  - For a ruling-satisfied advisory gate: the precondition and the ruling id
- **By**: the git user (`git config user.name`), or `unknown` if git has no
  user configured. Who the run is attributable to, regardless of what typed it.
- **Session**: what invoked the run. One of:
  - `typed` — a person typed the command
  - `orchestrator` — the orchestrating session dispatched it, followed by its
    session id in brackets where one is available: `orchestrator [a1b2c3]`
  - a lane label — the lane that ran it, e.g. `dbt-developer [staging 1/2]`
  - `autopilot` — `/wire:autopilot` ran it

  This is the same value the `invoked_by` telemetry property carries
  (`specs/utils/telemetry.md`), read from `WIRE_INVOKED_BY` and defaulting to
  `typed`. The log records it per row so the record on disk answers the same
  question telemetry answers in aggregate.
- **Duration**: Wall-clock time the workflow took. As the first action of the
  workflow, run `date +%s` and note the value as the start time. When
  appending the log row, run `date +%s` again and format the difference as
  `42s`, `4m 12s`, or `1h 03m`. If the start time was not captured, write
  `n/a`. Skill activation entries write `n/a`.
- **Tokens**: Total model tokens the run consumed (input + output, including
  cache reads and writes). Write the literal `n/a` — a model cannot measure
  its own token usage, and an estimated figure must never be written. On
  Claude Code, the Wire plugin's metrics hook backfills this cell with the
  measured value from the session transcript after the turn ends (see
  Metrics Backfill below). On runtimes without the hook (e.g. Gemini CLI)
  the cell stays `n/a`.
- **Cost (USD)**: Estimated cost of the measured tokens, e.g. `$0.42`. Same
  rule as Tokens: write `n/a`; the metrics hook backfills it where token
  usage can be measured. Never compute or guess this yourself.

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column, with `n/a` in all three metric columns:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> | <by> | <session> | n/a | n/a | n/a |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries, and never
   re-order them. A row is appended at the bottom, always. Rewriting the file
   to insert a row in timestamp order is a modification, not an append. One
   exception: the metrics hook (see Metrics Backfill below) may rewrite the
   Duration, Tokens, and Cost cells of the most recent row, and nothing else.
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
6. **Timestamps must not go backwards.** Because rows are appended in the order
   things happened, each row's timestamp is greater than or equal to the row
   above it. A row whose timestamp precedes its predecessor's means either the
   clock moved or a row was inserted out of order; both are record defects.
   `/wire:status-sync` flags them, naming both rows. This does not block any
   command — the log is written either way, and the flag is a repair prompt.
7. **Single writer in orchestrated mode.** When
   `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`'s operating model is in force,
   only the orchestrating session appends to this file. Lanes write their own
   state files and the orchestrator writes the log rows from them (rule 6 of
   the operating model). Outside orchestrated mode, every command writes its
   own row as it always has.
8. **Never fabricate metrics.** Tokens and Cost are written as `n/a` and only
   ever filled by tooling that measured them. A best guess is worse than
   `n/a` in a client-facing audit trail.

## Metrics Backfill (Claude Code)

The Wire Claude Code plugin registers a `Stop` hook (`hooks/wire-metrics.sh`)
that runs after each turn ends. It reads the session transcript, sums the
measured token usage from the most recent `/wire:*` command invocation to the
end of the turn, estimates its cost from a built-in price table, and rewrites
the Duration (only if still `n/a`), Tokens, and Cost cells of the log's most
recent row — only when that row's Command matches the command found in the
transcript and the row already has the metric columns. It never touches any
other cell or row. Commands that span several turns (e.g. a review waiting on
feedback) are re-summed on each turn's hook run, so the final backfill covers
the whole command. If the cost table does not recognise the model, Tokens is
still filled and Cost stays `n/a`. On runtimes without this hook, the metric
cells keep the values the workflow wrote.

## Legacy five-column rows

Logs written before the `By` and `Session` columns existed have four data
columns, and logs written before the `Duration`, `Tokens`, and `Cost (USD)`
columns existed have four or six. They stay valid and are never rewritten:

- A reader parses columns positionally and treats a missing `By`, `Session`,
  or metric column as unknown. It does not treat a shorter row as malformed
  and does not backfill it.
- Missing columns are added on the next write. A file whose header still has
  the older shape gets the new header written once, at the point the first
  nine-column row is appended; existing rows are left as they are, so a log
  can legitimately hold several shapes.
- Nothing derives meaning from the absence of the columns. An old row is not
  "typed"; it is unknown. A row without metric cells is unmeasured, not free
  or instant — and the metrics hook skips rows that lack the metric columns.
