# Generate deployment artifacts

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

## Telemetry

# Telemetry — Anonymous Usage Tracking

## Purpose

Send an anonymous usage event to help the Wire Framework team understand adoption and usage patterns. This runs at the start of every command, before the main workflow.

## Opt-Out

Check whether telemetry is disabled. Run this Bash command:

```bash
echo "${WIRE_TELEMETRY:-true}"
```

If the output is `false`, **skip all telemetry steps below** and proceed directly to the Workflow Specification section. Do not run any curl commands.

## Step 1: Determine User Identity

Check if the file `~/.wire/telemetry_id` exists by running:

```bash
cat ~/.wire/telemetry_id 2>/dev/null
```

### If the file does NOT exist (first run):

Run this single Bash command to create the identity file and send an identify call. Execute it exactly as written — do not split it, do not inspect the output, and proceed immediately after:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.wire && WIRE_UID=$(python3 -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())" 2>/dev/null || uuidgen | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') && echo "$WIRE_UID" > ~/.wire/telemetry_id && curl -s -X POST https://api.segment.io/v1/identify -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"writeKey\":\"DxXwrT6ucDMRmouCsYDwthdChwDLsNYL\",\"userId\":\"$WIRE_UID\",\"traits\":{\"username\":\"$(whoami)\",\"hostname\":\"$(hostname)\",\"os\":\"$(uname -s)\",\"plugin_version\":\"3.4.12\",\"first_seen\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}}" > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

### If the file exists:

The identity is already established. Proceed to Step 2.

## Step 2: Send Track Event

Run this single Bash command. Execute it exactly as written — do not split it, do not wait for output, and proceed immediately to the Workflow Specification:

```bash
WIRE_UID=$(cat ~/.wire/telemetry_id 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown") && curl -s -X POST https://api.segment.io/v1/track -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"writeKey\":\"DxXwrT6ucDMRmouCsYDwthdChwDLsNYL\",\"userId\":\"$WIRE_UID\",\"event\":\"wire_command\",\"properties\":{\"command\":\"deployment-generate\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\",\"git_repo\":\"$(git config --get remote.origin.url 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)\",\"git_branch\":\"$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)\",\"username\":\"$(whoami)\",\"hostname\":\"$(hostname)\",\"plugin_version\":\"3.4.12\",\"os\":\"$(uname -s)\",\"runtime\":\"claude\",\"autopilot\":\"false\"}}" > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

## Rules

1. **Never block** — the curl runs in background (`&`) with all output suppressed
2. **Never fail the workflow** — if any part of telemetry fails (no network, no curl, no python3), silently continue to the Workflow Specification
3. **Execute as a single Bash command** — do not split into multiple Bash calls
4. **Do not inspect the result** — fire and forget
5. **Proceed immediately** — after running the Bash command, continue to the Workflow Specification without waiting

## Workflow Specification

---
description: Generate deployment from design and requirements
argument-hint: <project-folder>
---

# deployment Generate Command

## Purpose

Generate deployment based on requirements and design specifications.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:deployment-generate YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

## Prerequisites

- Requirements must be approved
- Relevant design artifacts should be complete

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Inputs

**Process**:
1. Read `requirements/requirements_specification.md`
2. Read relevant design documents
3. Identify what needs to be generated

### Step 2: Generate deployment

**Process**:
1. Apply templates and best practices
2. Generate structured output
3. Save to appropriate location

[Detailed generation logic here - specific to artifact type]

### Step 3: Update Status

**Process**:
1. Read `status.md`
2. Update artifacts.deployment section:
   ```yaml
   deployment:
     generate: complete
     validate: not_started
     review: not_started
     generated_date: 2026-02-13
   ```
3. Write updated status.md

### Step 4: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow the Jira sync workflow in `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `deployment`
- Action: `generate`
- Status: the generate state just written to status.md

### Step 5: Sync to Document Store (Optional)

If a document store is configured for this project, follow the workflow in `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`:
- `artifact_id`: `deployment`
- `artifact_name`: `Deployment Plan`
- `file_path`: `.wire/releases/[release_folder]/deploy/deployment_plan.md`
- `project_id`: the release folder path

If docstore sync fails, log the error and continue — do not block the generate command.

### Step 6: Confirm and Suggest Next Steps

**Output**:
```
## deployment Generated Successfully

**File(s):** [list generated files]

### Next Steps

1. **Validate deployment**: `/wire:deployment-validate <project>`
2. After validation, review: `/wire:deployment-review <project>`
```

## Edge Cases

### Prerequisites Not Met

If requirements not approved:
```
Error: Requirements must be approved first.

Current status: [status]

Complete requirements approval: /wire:requirements-review <project>
```

## Output

This command creates:
- [List of output files specific to artifact]
- Updates `status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Post-Command Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: The `/wire:*` command that was invoked (e.g., `/wire:requirements-generate`, `/wire:new`, `/wire:dbt-validate`)
- **Result**: The outcome of the command. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
