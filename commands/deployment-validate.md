# Pre-deployment validation

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

# deployment Validation Command

## Purpose

Validate generated deployment against quality standards, naming conventions, and best practices.

## Usage

```bash
/wire:deployment-validate YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

## Prerequisites

- deployment must be generated (`/wire:deployment-generate` complete)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify deployment Exists

**Process**:
1. Check that `deployment.generate == complete` in status.md
2. Verify generated files exist

**If not generated**:
```
Error: deployment not generated yet.

Run `/wire:deployment-generate <project>` first.
```

### Step 2: Pipeline Connection Pre-flight Check

If `artifacts.pipeline.generate == complete` in status.md, follow `wire/specs/utils/pipeline_tool_status.md` to check pipeline connection health before proceeding.

| Health result | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| `healthy` | Proceed to Step 3 |
| `degraded` | Warn the user, list stale/warning connections, proceed |
| `unhealthy` | **FAIL** deployment validation — broken pipeline connections must be fixed before the platform can go live |

If `pipeline.generate != complete`, skip this check (pipeline may not be in scope for this project).

### Step 3: Run Validation Checks

**Validation Checklist**:

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Pipeline connections healthy | All connections `setup_state == connected` and last sync succeeded (via pipeline_tool_status) | Critical |
| [Check 2] | [Description] | Major |
| [Check 3] | [Description] | Info |

[Add project-specific validation checks here]

### Step 4: Generate Validation Report

**Output Format**:

```
## deployment Validation: [PROJECT_NAME]

**Status:** PASS | FAIL

### Validation Results

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| [Check 1] | ✅ | |
| [Check 2] | ✅ | |
| [Check 3] | ⚠️ | [Warning details] |

### Next Steps

1. **Review with stakeholders**: `/wire:deployment-review <project>`
```

### Step 5: Update Status

**Process**:
1. Read `status.md`
2. Update artifacts.deployment section:
   ```yaml
   deployment:
     generate: complete
     validate: pass | fail
     review: not_started
     validated_date: 2026-02-13
   ```
3. Write updated status.md

### Step 6: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow the Jira sync workflow in `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `deployment`
- Action: `validate`
- Status: the validate state just written to status.md (pass/fail)

## Edge Cases

### Validation Failures

If checks fail:
- Set validate status to `fail`
- List all issues
- Suggest fixes
- User must fix and re-validate

## Output

This command:
- Validates deployment completeness and quality
- Updates `status.md` with validation results
- Provides actionable feedback if issues found

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
