# Generate UAT plan

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.agent_v2` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.agent_v2/` in specs refers to the `.agent_v2/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

# uat Generate Command

## Purpose

Generate uat based on requirements and design specifications.

## Usage

```bash
/dp:uat:generate YYYYMMDD_project_name
```

## Prerequisites

- Requirements must be approved
- Relevant design artifacts should be complete

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Inputs

**Process**:
1. Read `requirements/requirements_specification.md`
2. Read relevant design documents
3. Identify what needs to be generated

### Step 2: Generate uat

**Process**:
1. Apply templates and best practices
2. Generate structured output
3. Save to appropriate location

[Detailed generation logic here - specific to artifact type]

### Step 3: Update Status

**Process**:
1. Read `status.md`
2. Update artifacts.uat section:
   ```yaml
   uat:
     generate: complete
     validate: not_started
     review: not_started
     generated_date: 2026-02-13
   ```
3. Write updated status.md

### Step 4: Sync to Jira (Optional)

Follow the Jira sync workflow in `dp/utils/jira_sync.md`:
- Artifact: `uat`
- Action: `generate`
- Status: the generate state just written to status.md

### Step 5: Confirm and Suggest Next Steps

**Output**:
```
## uat Generated Successfully

**File(s):** [list generated files]

### Next Steps

1. **Validate uat**: `/dp:uat:validate <project>`
2. After validation, review: `/dp:uat:review <project>`
```

## Edge Cases

### Prerequisites Not Met

If requirements not approved:
```
Error: Requirements must be approved first.

Current status: [status]

Complete requirements approval: /dp:requirements:review <project>
```

## Output

This command creates:
- [List of output files specific to artifact]
- Updates `status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Post-Command Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /dp:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: The `/dp:*` command that was invoked (e.g., `/dp:requirements:generate`, `/dp:new`, `/dp:dbt:validate`)
- **Result**: The outcome of the command. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/dp:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/dp:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/dp:remove` deleted a project
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
