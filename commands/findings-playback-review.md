# Sponsor playback session — Sponsor Validation Checklist (the canonical gate)

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true
---

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'findings-playback-review',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

# Findings Playback — Review

## Purpose

**The canonical client-facing review gate of a SOP discovery release.**

This is not an internal review. The review action *is* the sponsor playback meeting — the deck is presented live (by Lewis or Mark per the playbook), the meeting is recorded via Fathom, and the **Sponsor Validation Checklist** is captured at the close.

State transitions:
- `complete` after the deck has been generated and validated
- `reviewed` after the playback meeting has been held (Fathom recording attached)
- `approved` **only when every item on the Sponsor Validation Checklist is `true`**

If any checklist item is `no`, the release stays at `reviewed` and a 30-minute follow-up sponsor session is scheduled (explicit in the playbook's failure modes).

Models Phase 4 (playback meeting + Sponsor Validation Checklist) of the Canonical Discovery Playbook.

## Inputs

- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/playback/findings_playback.html`
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/playback/findings_playback_validation.md` (must be PASS or PASS WITH WARNINGS)
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/discovery_analyses.md`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-flight

1. Resolve `$ARGUMENTS`. Confirm validation has passed. If FAIL, stop: "Resolve validation failures before holding the playback."
2. Confirm `status.md → sponsor_validation.vision_statement_excerpt` is set. If null, prompt the consultant to set it now from the deck's Vision Statement slide. The playback is partly about the sponsor signing off on this — it needs to exist.

### Step 2: Capture playback meeting context

Ask the consultant:

```
Has the playback meeting been held?

(a) Yes — recorded via Fathom, ready to capture the Sponsor Validation Checklist
(b) Not yet — confirm date and presenter
```

If (b): record the planned date and presenter under `status.md → sponsor_validation.playback_date` and `sponsor_validation.preferred_delivery_option: null`, then stop with: "Re-run this command after the playback has been held."

If (a): proceed.

### Step 3: Pull Fathom transcript

Ask for the Fathom URL for the playback recording. Use the Fathom MCP server to pull:
- Full transcript
- Meeting summary
- Sponsor's verbal endorsements (or refusals) on each of the seven Sponsor Validation Checklist items

This is the most important Fathom integration in Wire — the sponsor's verbal "yes, this is what we want" against the Vision Statement is, per the playbook, the most important artefact in the engagement after the SoW itself.

### Step 4: Pre-fill the checklist from the transcript

For each of the seven Sponsor Validation Checklist items, walk the transcript and propose a value (`true` / `false` / `unclear`). Surface the supporting quote (verbatim) for each.

Then present each item to the consultant for confirmation:

```
For each of the 7 Sponsor Validation Checklist items, confirm the value based on the Fathom transcript and your in-room recall.

1. **Maturity Curve pin agreed.**
   Proposed: <true/false/unclear> based on quote: "<verbatim>"
   Confirm? (yes / no / change to false / change to unclear)

2. **Hierarchy of Needs diagnosis agreed.** ...
3. **PPT diagnosis agreed.** ...
4. **Vision Statement endorsed (both paragraphs).** ...
5. **Solution Initiatives confirmed.** ...
6. **Preferred Delivery Option named (Build / Pair / Coach).** ...
7. **Open conflicts resolved (or follow-up scheduled).** ...
```

For item 6, also capture the named delivery option ("build" / "pair" / "coach" / null) under `sponsor_validation.preferred_delivery_option`.

For any `unclear` or `false`, ask:

```
What follow-up action is needed for this item?
```

### Step 5: Determine the review outcome

If every item is `true`, outcome = **Approved (playback signed off)**.

If any item is `false` or `unclear`, outcome = **Reviewed — follow-up required**. Schedule a 30-min sponsor follow-up session within 1 week. Record the follow-up date under `sponsor_validation.follow_up_session`.

### Step 6: Record the result

Update `status.md`:

```yaml
sponsor_validation:
  playback_held: true
  playback_date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
  playback_fathom_url: <URL>
  maturity_pin: "<confirmed pin>"
  vision_statement_excerpt: "<first 200 chars of vision statement>"
  preferred_delivery_option: "<build|pair|coach|null>"
  checklist:
    maturity_pin_agreed: <true|false>
    hierarchy_diagnosis_agreed: <true|false>
    ppt_diagnosis_agreed: <true|false>
    vision_statement_endorsed: <true|false>
    solution_initiatives_confirmed: <true|false>
    delivery_option_named: <true|false>
    conflicts_resolved: <true|false>
  follow_up_session: <YYYY-MM-DD or null>

artifacts:
  findings_playback:
    review: complete       # = playback held and checklist captured
                           # Note: this is "reviewed" in workflow terms,
                           # not "approved". Approved = checklist all true.
```

### Step 7: Write the Playback Meeting Notes

**Output**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/playback/playback_meeting_notes.md`

```markdown
# Findings Playback — Meeting Notes

**Date**: <YYYY-MM-DD>
**Presenter**: <Lewis / Mark>
**Fathom recording**: <URL>
**Sponsor**: <name>
**Outcome**: <Approved (signed off) | Reviewed — follow-up required>

## Sponsor Validation Checklist

| # | Item | Result | Supporting quote |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Maturity Curve pin agreed (<pin>) | ✅ / ❌ | "<quote>" |
| 2 | Hierarchy of Needs diagnosis agreed | ✅ / ❌ | "<quote>" |
| 3 | PPT diagnosis agreed | ✅ / ❌ | "<quote>" |
| 4 | Vision Statement endorsed | ✅ / ❌ | "<quote>" |
| 5 | Solution Initiatives 1–5 confirmed | ✅ / ❌ | "<quote>" |
| 6 | Preferred Delivery Option named (<option>) | ✅ / ❌ | "<quote>" |
| 7 | Open conflicts resolved | ✅ / ❌ | "<quote>" |

## Decisions taken

[Bullet list — what the sponsor decided in the meeting]

## Concerns raised (and how they were addressed)

[Bullet list]

## Follow-ups

- [ ] Owner — action — due date

## Next session

[If approved]: Delivery Roadmap session (or release-spawn directly).
[If follow-up required]: 30-min sponsor session on <date> to resolve <items>.
```

### Step 8: Sync to document store

Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. The Playback Meeting Notes go to the Confluence "Playback Meeting Notes" page named in the playbook folder structure (`5. Findings Playback / Playback Meeting Notes`).

### Step 9: Output review summary

If approved:
```
## Findings Playback Review — Approved ✅

All 7 Sponsor Validation Checklist items signed off.

**Maturity pin**: <pin>
**Preferred Delivery Option**: <build/pair/coach>
**Vision Statement endorsed**: yes

### Next Steps

1. Generate the Delivery Roadmap:
   /wire:delivery-roadmap-generate $ARGUMENTS

2. Or spawn Release 1 directly:
   /wire:release-spawn $ARGUMENTS
```

If follow-up required:
```
## Findings Playback Review — Follow-up Required ⚠️

Items not yet endorsed:
- [list]

**Follow-up session**: <date>

The release will remain at `reviewed` until every checklist item is true. Do not start Release 1 until the playback is approved — the playbook's failure-mode table specifically calls out the catastrophic cost of skipping this.
```

### Step 10: Approval gate

The release-level "approved" state is only set when:
- `sponsor_validation.playback_held == true`, AND
- every `sponsor_validation.checklist.*` is `true`

This is checked by `/wire:status` and surfaced as a hard gate before `/wire:release-spawn` can chain into a delivery release.

## Output Files

- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/playback/findings_playback.html` (no body changes, but the review captures Fathom URL etc)
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/playback/playback_meeting_notes.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`


---

## Recording the sign-off under `modelling_led`

The playback is the sign-off gate, and under this profile it signs off five
artifacts at once. Record the outcome per item, not once for the deck:

```yaml
sponsor_validation:
  profile: modelling_led
  held_date: YYYY-MM-DD
  sponsor: <name>
  items:
    current_state_accepted:     accepted | accepted_with_changes | rejected | not_applicable
    conceptual_model_signed_off: ...
    logical_model_signed_off:    ...
    data_flow_accepted:          ...
    roadmap_agreed:              ...
```

An item recorded `accepted_with_changes` names the changes and the artifact they
land in, and that artifact returns to `review: changes_requested`. The playback
itself is `approved` only when every item is `accepted`, `accepted_with_changes`
with the changes recorded, or `not_applicable` with a reason.

A rejected item blocks the playback. The roadmap that follows a rejected
conceptual or logical model would be costed against a model the client does not
accept.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail | By | Session | Duration | Tokens | Cost (USD) |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|----|---------|----------|--------|------------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> | <by> | <session> | <duration> | n/a | n/a |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition, or an advisory gate satisfied by a director's ruling
  - `mode` — the director handed control over or took it back ("you drive" / "I'll drive"), per `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason
  - For a ruling-satisfied advisory gate: the precondition and the ruling id
- **By**: the git user (`git config user.name`), or `unknown` if git has no
  user configured. Who the run is attributable to, regardless of what typed it.
- **Session**: what invoked the run. One of:
  - `typed` — a person typed the command
  - `orchestrator` — the orchestrating session dispatched it, followed by its
    session id in brackets where one is available: `orchestrator [a1b2c3]`
  - a lane label — the lane that ran it, e.g. `dbt-developer [staging 1/2]`
  - `autopilot` — `/wire:autopilot` ran it

  This is the same value the `invoked_by` telemetry property carries
  (`specs/utils/telemetry.md`), read from `WIRE_INVOKED_BY` and defaulting to
  `typed`. The log records it per row so the record on disk answers the same
  question telemetry answers in aggregate.
- **Duration**: Wall-clock time the workflow took. As the first action of the
  workflow, run `date +%s` and note the value as the start time. When
  appending the log row, run `date +%s` again and format the difference as
  `42s`, `4m 12s`, or `1h 03m`. If the start time was not captured, write
  `n/a`. Skill activation entries write `n/a`.
- **Tokens**: Total model tokens the run consumed (input + output, including
  cache reads and writes). Write the literal `n/a` — a model cannot measure
  its own token usage, and an estimated figure must never be written. On
  Claude Code, the Wire plugin's metrics hook backfills this cell with the
  measured value from the session transcript after the turn ends (see
  Metrics Backfill below). On runtimes without the hook (e.g. Gemini CLI)
  the cell stays `n/a`.
- **Cost (USD)**: Estimated cost of the measured tokens, e.g. `$0.42`. Same
  rule as Tokens: write `n/a`; the metrics hook backfills it where token
  usage can be measured. Never compute or guess this yourself.

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column, with `n/a` in all three metric columns:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> | <by> | <session> | n/a | n/a | n/a |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries, and never
   re-order them. A row is appended at the bottom, always. Rewriting the file
   to insert a row in timestamp order is a modification, not an append. One
   exception: the metrics hook (see Metrics Backfill below) may rewrite the
   Duration, Tokens, and Cost cells of the most recent row, and nothing else.
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
6. **Timestamps must not go backwards.** Because rows are appended in the order
   things happened, each row's timestamp is greater than or equal to the row
   above it. A row whose timestamp precedes its predecessor's means either the
   clock moved or a row was inserted out of order; both are record defects.
   `/wire:status-sync` flags them, naming both rows. This does not block any
   command — the log is written either way, and the flag is a repair prompt.
7. **Single writer in orchestrated mode.** When
   `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`'s operating model is in force,
   only the orchestrating session appends to this file. Lanes write their own
   state files and the orchestrator writes the log rows from them (rule 6 of
   the operating model). Outside orchestrated mode, every command writes its
   own row as it always has.
8. **Never fabricate metrics.** Tokens and Cost are written as `n/a` and only
   ever filled by tooling that measured them. A best guess is worse than
   `n/a` in a client-facing audit trail.

## Metrics Backfill (Claude Code)

The Wire Claude Code plugin registers a `Stop` hook (`hooks/wire-metrics.sh`)
that runs after each turn ends. It reads the session transcript, sums the
measured token usage from the most recent `/wire:*` command invocation to the
end of the turn, estimates its cost from a built-in price table, and rewrites
the Duration (only if still `n/a`), Tokens, and Cost cells of the log's most
recent row — only when that row's Command matches the command found in the
transcript and the row already has the metric columns. It never touches any
other cell or row. Commands that span several turns (e.g. a review waiting on
feedback) are re-summed on each turn's hook run, so the final backfill covers
the whole command. If the cost table does not recognise the model, Tokens is
still filled and Cost stays `n/a`. On runtimes without this hook, the metric
cells keep the values the workflow wrote.

## Legacy five-column rows

Logs written before the `By` and `Session` columns existed have four data
columns, and logs written before the `Duration`, `Tokens`, and `Cost (USD)`
columns existed have four or six. They stay valid and are never rewritten:

- A reader parses columns positionally and treats a missing `By`, `Session`,
  or metric column as unknown. It does not treat a shorter row as malformed
  and does not backfill it.
- Missing columns are added on the next write. A file whose header still has
  the older shape gets the new header written once, at the point the first
  nine-column row is appended; existing rows are left as they are, so a log
  can legitimately hold several shapes.
- Nothing derives meaning from the absence of the columns. An old row is not
  "typed"; it is unknown. A row without metric cells is unmeasured, not free
  or instant — and the metrics hook skips rows that lack the metric columns.
