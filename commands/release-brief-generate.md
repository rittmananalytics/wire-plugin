# Generate formal release brief from the approved pitch

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command
- `specs/<path>.md` references are shared workflow docs shipped with this plugin — read them from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/specs/<path>.md`. If the path matches a Wire command (e.g. `specs/requirements/generate.md`), it means that command (`/wire:requirements-generate`) and its spec is already embedded in the command file.

## Tracing (opt-in, off by default)

---
description: Internal utility — opt-in step-level execution tracing to .wire/releases/<release>/trace.jsonl when WIRE_TRACE=true
---

# Tracing — Detailed, Opt-In, Step-Level Execution Trace

## Purpose

`execution_log.md` records one terse row per whole command (timestamp, command, result, a detail string capped at 120 characters). That's enough for a normal audit trail, but it can't answer "what actually happened inside that command, step by step" — which specific files it read, what it inferred, what it proposed, what a consultant decided, why. Tracing exists for engagements that want that depth: a complete, structured, append-only record of every step of every command, scoped to the release and release type it ran under.

**Off by default.** Tracing never runs unless `WIRE_TRACE=true` is set in the shell environment. If it isn't, skip this entire section — do nothing, check nothing further, proceed straight to the Workflow Specification exactly as if this section didn't exist. This is the common case and must add zero overhead.

## Where it writes

`.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl` — one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), append-only, alongside that release's `status.md` and `execution_log.md`.

For commands not scoped to a specific release (cross-cutting utilities with `release_types: []` in their own front-matter, or any command whose argument isn't a release folder), write to `.wire/trace.jsonl` at the engagement level instead, with `release` and `release_type` fields set to `null`.

This file is **local only** — nothing in it is ever sent anywhere, unlike the anonymous Segment telemetry event described elsewhere. It stays on the consultant's machine, inside the engagement's own repo, exactly like `execution_log.md`.

## What to log, and when

If `WIRE_TRACE=true`:

1. **Resolve context once, before anything else**: the release folder (from this command's own argument, if it has one) and `release_type` (read `.wire/releases/<release_folder>/status.md`'s `project_type` or `release_type` field). If this command has no release-folder argument, both are `null`.
2. **Emit a `command_start` event** before beginning the Workflow Specification below.
3. **As you work through the Workflow Specification's own numbered steps, emit a `step` event after completing each one** — and where a step itself has meaningfully distinct numbered sub-parts (e.g. "check location A, then location B, then infer a match, then propose it"), treat each of those as its own step event too rather than collapsing them into one. The `detail` field has no length limit and is not a summary — write what actually happened: values found, files read, decisions made and why, what was proposed and what the consultant chose. If this step involved the data model registry or any other external/optional resource, log it explicitly: whether it was reached, what was searched, what matched (or didn't, and why not), and whether/how the result was used downstream.
4. **Emit a `command_end` event** when the workflow finishes, with the same `result` value this command would write to `execution_log.md` (`complete`, `pass`, `fail`, `approved`, etc.).

## How to emit an event

Use this pattern for every event (adjust the heredoc body and the Python literals per call — this is a template, not a fixed script):

```bash
[ "${WIRE_TRACE:-false}" = "true" ] && {
  mkdir -p ".wire/releases/<release_folder>" 2>/dev/null
  cat > "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt" << 'WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF'
<the full, untruncated detail text for this event — safe to include quotes,
newlines, code snippets, anything; this heredoc is not shell-interpreted>
WIRE_TRACE_DETAIL_EOF
  python3 -c "
import json, datetime
detail = open('/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt').read().rstrip('\n')
event = {
    'ts': datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'),
    'release': '<release_folder_or_null>',
    'release_type': '<release_type_or_null>',
    'command': 'release-brief-generate',
    'event': '<command_start|step|command_end>',
    'step': '<step_number_or_null>',
    'step_name': '<step_heading_or_null>',
    'result': '<result_value_or_null>',
    'detail': detail,
}
with open('.wire/releases/<release_folder>/trace.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + chr(10))
"
  rm -f "/tmp/wire_trace_detail_$$.txt"
}
```

- `<release_folder_or_null>` / `<release_type_or_null>`: from Step 1 above; write the literal JSON `null` (no quotes) if either doesn't apply, or a quoted string if it does.
- `event`: `command_start`, `step`, or `command_end`.
- `step` / `step_name`: `null` for `command_start`/`command_end`; the step's own number (e.g. `"1.5"`) and heading (e.g. `"Check for a Canonical Vertical Match"`) for a `step` event.
- `result`: `null` except on `command_end`.
- Adjust the file path in the final `open(...)` call to `.wire/trace.jsonl` for engagement-level (non-release-scoped) commands.

## Rules

1. **Never block or fail the workflow.** If a trace write fails for any reason (disk full, permissions), continue the workflow regardless — trace failures are never surfaced to the user and never stop anything.
2. **Append only** — never rewrite or delete existing lines in `trace.jsonl`.
3. **This is additive to `execution_log.md` and Telemetry, not a replacement for either.** All three continue exactly as documented elsewhere; tracing is a separate, optional, much finer-grained record for engagements that opt in.
4. **Don't summarize into brevity.** The entire point of this mechanism over `execution_log.md` is that it isn't limited to a 120-character line — write the real detail.

## Automatic Validation (on by default)

---
description: Internal utility — injected auto-validate section so generate commands run their matching validate step automatically and fold the result into their output
---

Every `generate` command that has a matching `validate` command for the
same artifact runs that validate step automatically as part of generate —
by default, with no separate command to remember. This section only appears
on commands where that applies; artifacts with no separate validate step at
all (e.g. mockups, workshops, UAT) never carry this section.

## Step: Check `auto_validate`

Read this command's own `auto_validate` front-matter field, in the Workflow
Specification below. Two states:

- **Absent, or `true`** (the default — most artifacts): auto-validate runs.
- **`false`**: this artifact's validate step is expensive — it runs real
  code, queries a live warehouse or BI tool, or otherwise does IO beyond
  re-reading local files — so it does not run automatically. Skip to
  "If `auto_validate: false`" below.

## If `auto_validate` is absent or `true`: run validate automatically

Once this command finishes writing its artifact, before ending:

1. Run this artifact's own `/wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate` workflow
   in full, exactly as if the consultant had typed it themselves — same
   inputs, same `status.md` write to `artifacts.<artifact>.validate`, same
   report. This is not optional or an extra step layered on top; it is the
   default behavior for this artifact.
2. Fold the result into this command's own closing output rather than
   presenting it as a separate command run:
   - **PASS** — add a single closing line: `✅ Auto-validated — PASS`. The
     full report already went to `status.md`/`execution_log.md`, exactly as
     it would from a standalone validate run — no need to repeat it here.
   - **FAIL** — surface the validate command's own failure report in full,
     exactly as running validate standalone would show it, so the
     consultant sees what's wrong immediately without running anything
     else themselves.
3. This never blocks or undoes generate itself — the artifact is written
   either way, and its content is never rolled back because validate
   failed. Auto-validation only means validate has already run and its
   result is already on record by the time generate finishes, instead of
   waiting for the consultant to remember to run it separately.

## If `auto_validate` is `false`: state this plainly, don't run it

Do not run validate. End with a line naming why, as specifically as this
spec's own context makes possible (e.g. "runs `dbt run`/`dbt test`",
"queries the live target warehouse", "calls the Looker API directly") —
fall back to "performs live checks against an external system" only if no
more specific reason is evident from context:

```
⚠ This artifact's validate step [reason] and does not run automatically.
Run /wire:<artifact-with-dashes>-validate <release_folder> before
requesting review — review is blocked until it passes.
```

## Why this is always safe either way

`review` already requires `validate: PASS` for this same artifact as one of
its own declared preconditions (see `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md`) —
this is existing, independent enforcement, not something added by this
section. So an `auto_validate: false` opt-out never lets an artifact reach
review unvalidated; it only decides *when* the consultant pays validate's
cost — automatically on every draft (the default), or once, on their own
schedule, before requesting review (the opt-out). Auto-validation is a
convenience that closes the "forgot to run it" gap for the common case; the
gate that actually prevents unvalidated work from being reviewed was already
there.

## Workflow Specification

wire_schema: "1.0"
command: generate
artifact: release_brief
domain: discovery
release_types:
  - discovery_shape_up
action_type: artifact
logs_execution: true
inputs:

description: Generate formal release brief from the approved pitch

---

## Auto-Delegation

Follow `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` before proceeding.

---

# Release Brief Generate Command

Follow `specs/utils/discovery_analyst_delegate.md` before executing the workflow below.

## Purpose

Generates a formal release brief from the approved pitch. The release brief is the commitment document — it specifies exactly what will be delivered, what the team will do, the timeline, the constraints, and the sign-off requirements. It is more precise than the pitch and is used to formally begin work.

## Inputs

**Required**:
- `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/pitch.md` — must be reviewed and approved

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate Release and Read Pitch

Resolve release folder. Read `planning/pitch.md`. Verify pitch has been approved (check status.md `pitch.review`). If not approved, stop and prompt the user to complete the pitch review first.

Also read:
- `engagement/context.md` if present
- `engagement/sow.md` if present (for budget and contract terms)

### Step 2: Identify Downstream Delivery Releases

From Section 8 of the pitch (Downstream Releases), extract the planned delivery releases. If Section 8 is empty or "TBD", ask:

```
Based on the approved pitch, what delivery releases will this discovery release produce?
(e.g. "01-data-foundation: pipeline_only, 02-reporting: dashboard_extension")

List them as: [name]: [type]
```

### Step 2b: Establish Primary Analytical Focus and Goal Hierarchy

Before generating the brief, ask explicitly:

```
The SOW/pitch lists the following engagement goals:
[list goals extracted from pitch or SOW]

1. Which of these is the PRIMARY use case — the single analytical domain that all discovery work is in service of?
   (e.g. "Customer acquisition funnel", "Merchant 360", "Operational productivity reporting")

2. For each remaining goal, assign a priority:
   - Primary: must achieve in this engagement
   - Secondary: assess and recommend only — do not design or build
   - Future: out of scope this engagement, note and defer
```

Record the answers as:
- `primary_analytical_focus`: [the ONE named use case]
- `goal_hierarchy`: a table of goals with assigned priorities

### Step 3: Generate the Release Brief

**Output location**: `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/planning/release_brief.md`

Apply the reference-legibility convention (`specs/utils/reference_legibility.md`): the deliverable codes (D1, D2, …) and assumption codes (A1, A2, …) minted below are defined by their table rows, which carry their plain-language names. If the brief cites a code defined in another artifact, add a Reference key section in the canonical format from that spec.

```markdown
# Release Brief: [Release Name]

**Engagement**: [client_name]
**Release folder**: [folder_name]
**Date**: [generation_date]
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Draft

---

## 0. Primary Analytical Focus

**Priority use case**: [ONE named use case agreed with the client at kick-off]

All discovery work — stakeholder interviews, entity model, data source assessment, solution definition — is conducted in service of this use case. Other analytical domains surfaced during discovery will be noted for future phases but will not be scoped or designed during this release.

**Goal hierarchy**:

| Goal | Priority | What this engagement will do |
|------|----------|------------------------------|
| [Goal 1] | Primary | Design and deliver |
| [Goal 2] | Primary | Design and deliver |
| [Goal 3] | Secondary | Assess and recommend — do not design solutions |
| [Goal 4] | Secondary | Assess and recommend — do not design solutions |
| [Goal 5] | Future | Note and defer to a future release |

**What this discovery will not produce**: A comprehensive data strategy, a full analytics operating model, or remediation plans for organisational or governance issues that fall outside the analytical delivery function. Where root causes are found that go beyond this scope, they will be documented and handed back to the client.

## 1. Executive Summary

[2–3 sentence summary of what this release delivers and why. Written for a stakeholder who hasn't read the pitch.]

## 2. Appetite and Timeline

**Appetite**: [Small batch — 1–2 weeks | Big batch — 6 weeks]
**Confirmed by**: [who approved the pitch]
**Start date**: [date or TBD]
**End date**: [date or TBD]

## 3. Deliverables

| # | Deliverable | Description | Acceptance Criteria | Owner |
|---|------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| D1 | [name] | [what it is] | [how we know it's done] | [name/role] |
| D2 | [name] | [what it is] | [how we know it's done] | [name/role] |

**Completion definition**: This release is complete when all deliverables above are signed off by [approver role].

## 4. Downstream Releases Produced

This discovery release will produce the following delivery releases upon completion of the sprint plan:

| Release Name | Type | Scope Summary | Priority |
|--------------|------|---------------|----------|
| [name] | [type] | [1-line scope] | 1 |
| [name] | [type] | [1-line scope] | 2 |

These releases will be created by running: `/wire:release-spawn [folder]` at the end of the sprint plan.

## 5. What Is Out of Scope

[From pitch Section 5 (No-gos) — formalised as contractual boundaries]

- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]
- [Item 3]

**Scope change process**: Any additions to scope require a new pitch or formal change request.

## 6. Assumptions

| # | Assumption | Impact if Wrong | Owner |
|---|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| A1 | [assumption] | [impact] | [owner] |

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| [risk] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [mitigation] | [owner] |

## 8. Resources

| Role | Name | Allocation | Responsibilities |
|------|------|------------|-----------------|
| Engagement Lead | [name] | [%] | [responsibilities] |
| [role] | [name] | [%] | [responsibilities] |

## 9. Budget

**Engagement budget**: [from SOW, or "to be confirmed"]
**This release**: [estimated cost, or "included in engagement budget"]
**Payment milestone**: [when this release triggers a payment, if applicable]

## 10. Dependencies and Prerequisites

| Dependency | Owner | Required By | Status |
|-----------|-------|-------------|--------|
| [dependency] | [owner] | [date] | Open |

## 11. Communication and Governance

**Stakeholder updates**: [frequency and format]
**Decision-making authority**: [who can approve changes]
**Escalation path**: [who to escalate to if blocked]

## 12. Sign-off

| Role | Name | Signature | Date |
|------|------|-----------|------|
| Client sponsor | | | |
| Engagement lead | | | |

*Signature indicates agreement with the scope, timeline, budget, and deliverables defined in this document.*
```

### Step 4: Update Release Status

```yaml
release_brief:
  generate: "complete"
  validate: "not_started"
  review: "not_started"
  file: "planning/release_brief.md"
  generated_date: [today's date]
primary_analytical_focus: "[value captured in Step 2b]"
goal_hierarchy_captured: true
```

### Step 5: Sync to Document Store (Optional)

If a document store is configured for this project, follow the workflow in `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`:
- `artifact_id`: `release_brief`
- `artifact_name`: `Release Brief`
- `file_path`: `.wire/releases/[release_folder]/artifacts/release_brief.md`
- `project_id`: the release folder path (e.g. `releases/01-discovery`)

If docstore sync fails, log the error and continue — do not block the generate command.

### Step 6: Confirm and Suggest Next Steps

```
## Release Brief Generated

File: .wire/releases/[folder]/planning/release_brief.md

Downstream releases identified: [list from Section 4]

### Next Steps

1. Validate the release brief:
   /wire:release-brief-validate [folder]

2. Review and sign off with the client:
   /wire:release-brief-review [folder]

3. When signed off, generate the sprint plan:
   /wire:sprint-plan-generate [folder]
```

## Output Files

- `.wire/releases/[folder]/planning/release_brief.md`
- Updated `.wire/releases/[folder]/status.md`

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

---
description: Internal utility — appends a log entry to the project's execution log after any generate/validate/review workflow or skill activation
---

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail | By | Session | Duration | Tokens | Cost (USD) |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|----|---------|----------|--------|------------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> | <by> | <session> | <duration> | n/a | n/a |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
  - `override` — `specs/utils/precondition_gate.md` recorded a consultant overriding an unmet precondition, or an advisory gate satisfied by a director's ruling
  - `mode` — the director handed control over or took it back ("you drive" / "I'll drive"), per `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill
  - For override: the unmet precondition, who overrode it, and their reason
  - For a ruling-satisfied advisory gate: the precondition and the ruling id
- **By**: the git user (`git config user.name`), or `unknown` if git has no
  user configured. Who the run is attributable to, regardless of what typed it.
- **Session**: what invoked the run. One of:
  - `typed` — a person typed the command
  - `orchestrator` — the orchestrating session dispatched it, followed by its
    session id in brackets where one is available: `orchestrator [a1b2c3]`
  - a lane label — the lane that ran it, e.g. `dbt-developer [staging 1/2]`
  - `autopilot` — `/wire:autopilot` ran it

  This is the same value the `invoked_by` telemetry property carries
  (`specs/utils/telemetry.md`), read from `WIRE_INVOKED_BY` and defaulting to
  `typed`. The log records it per row so the record on disk answers the same
  question telemetry answers in aggregate.
- **Duration**: Wall-clock time the workflow took. As the first action of the
  workflow, run `date +%s` and note the value as the start time. When
  appending the log row, run `date +%s` again and format the difference as
  `42s`, `4m 12s`, or `1h 03m`. If the start time was not captured, write
  `n/a`. Skill activation entries write `n/a`.
- **Tokens**: Total model tokens the run consumed (input + output, including
  cache reads and writes). Write the literal `n/a` — a model cannot measure
  its own token usage, and an estimated figure must never be written. On
  Claude Code, the Wire plugin's metrics hook backfills this cell with the
  measured value from the session transcript after the turn ends (see
  Metrics Backfill below). On runtimes without the hook (e.g. Gemini CLI)
  the cell stays `n/a`.
- **Cost (USD)**: Estimated cost of the measured tokens, e.g. `$0.42`. Same
  rule as Tokens: write `n/a`; the metrics hook backfills it where token
  usage can be measured. Never compute or guess this yourself.

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column, with `n/a` in all three metric columns:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> | <by> | <session> | n/a | n/a | n/a |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration-inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. After the last warning (only when at least one was emitted), add one closing line offering the repair path:
   ```
   Run /wire:status-sync <release-folder> to reconcile the record (see specs/utils/status_sync.md).
   ```
   The offer is informational only — never block the calling command and never run the sync automatically.
7. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries, and never
   re-order them. A row is appended at the bottom, always. Rewriting the file
   to insert a row in timestamp order is a modification, not an append. One
   exception: the metrics hook (see Metrics Backfill below) may rewrite the
   Duration, Tokens, and Cost cells of the most recent row, and nothing else.
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
6. **Timestamps must not go backwards.** Because rows are appended in the order
   things happened, each row's timestamp is greater than or equal to the row
   above it. A row whose timestamp precedes its predecessor's means either the
   clock moved or a row was inserted out of order; both are record defects.
   `/wire:status-sync` flags them, naming both rows. This does not block any
   command — the log is written either way, and the flag is a repair prompt.
7. **Single writer in orchestrated mode.** When
   `specs/utils/director_operating_model.md`'s operating model is in force,
   only the orchestrating session appends to this file. Lanes write their own
   state files and the orchestrator writes the log rows from them (rule 6 of
   the operating model). Outside orchestrated mode, every command writes its
   own row as it always has.
8. **Never fabricate metrics.** Tokens and Cost are written as `n/a` and only
   ever filled by tooling that measured them. A best guess is worse than
   `n/a` in a client-facing audit trail.

## Metrics Backfill (Claude Code)

The Wire Claude Code plugin registers a `Stop` hook (`hooks/wire-metrics.sh`)
that runs after each turn ends. It reads the session transcript, sums the
measured token usage from the most recent `/wire:*` command invocation to the
end of the turn, estimates its cost from a built-in price table, and rewrites
the Duration (only if still `n/a`), Tokens, and Cost cells of the log's most
recent row — only when that row's Command matches the command found in the
transcript and the row already has the metric columns. It never touches any
other cell or row. Commands that span several turns (e.g. a review waiting on
feedback) are re-summed on each turn's hook run, so the final backfill covers
the whole command. If the cost table does not recognise the model, Tokens is
still filled and Cost stays `n/a`. On runtimes without this hook, the metric
cells keep the values the workflow wrote.

## Legacy five-column rows

Logs written before the `By` and `Session` columns existed have four data
columns, and logs written before the `Duration`, `Tokens`, and `Cost (USD)`
columns existed have four or six. They stay valid and are never rewritten:

- A reader parses columns positionally and treats a missing `By`, `Session`,
  or metric column as unknown. It does not treat a shorter row as malformed
  and does not backfill it.
- Missing columns are added on the next write. A file whose header still has
  the older shape gets the new header written once, at the point the first
  nine-column row is appended; existing rows are left as they are, so a log
  can legitimately hold several shapes.
- Nothing derives meaning from the absence of the columns. An old row is not
  "typed"; it is unknown. A row without metric cells is unmeasured, not free
  or instant — and the metrics hook skips rows that lack the metric columns.
