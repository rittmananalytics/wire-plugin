# Validate target setup scripts

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Path Configuration

- **Projects**: `.wire` (project data and status files)

When following the workflow specification below, resolve paths as follows:
- `.wire/` in specs refers to the `.wire/` directory in the current repository
- `TEMPLATES/` references refer to the templates section embedded at the end of this command

# Target Setup — Validate

## Validation Checks

**Check 1 — All in-scope schemas have DDL**
Every schema from the db_object audit with a non-exclude migration approach has a CREATE statement in `01_schemas.sql`.
PASS/FAIL.

**Check 2 — All recreate_ddl tables have DDL**
Every table with `migration_approach: recreate_ddl` has a CREATE TABLE statement in `02_tables.sql`.
PASS/FAIL with gaps.

**Check 3 — No TODO items in schema/table DDL without tracking notes**
Every `-- TODO` comment in the DDL is also listed in the MANIFEST.md as a known open item.
PASS/FAIL.

**Check 4 — Column type translations are complete**
Every column in the table DDL has a target-platform type (no untranslated source types remain).
PASS/FAIL.

**Check 5 — Security DDL present**
`04_security.sql` is non-empty and contains at least the GRANT statements for critical roles identified in the security audit.
PASS/FAIL.

**Check 6 — MANIFEST.md lists all scripts**
Every SQL script file written is listed in MANIFEST.md with a description — the four core scripts (`01`–`04`), plus `05_udfs.sql` when it was generated.
PASS/FAIL.

**Check 7 — SQL syntax is valid for target platform**
Perform a static syntax check: scan for keywords illegal on the target platform (e.g., BQ-only syntax in Snowflake scripts, or vice versa).
PASS: No illegal syntax found.
FAIL: List lines with illegal syntax.

**Check 8 — UDF layer complete (when a UDF layer exists)**
Read `audit/batch_zero_plan.json`. If it exists and has `layer: udf` entries:
- Every `action: translate` UDF has a `CREATE FUNCTION` statement in `05_udfs.sql`, and the statements are in tier order (a UDF appears after every UDF it depends on, with `create_udfs` last).
- Every `action: redesign` UDF is named in the MANIFEST's **UDF redesign decisions** section — not silently emitted as a `CREATE FUNCTION`.
- No untranslated source-dialect function bodies remain in the emitted UDF DDL (same scan as Check 7, applied to `05_udfs.sql`).
If `batch_zero_plan.json` is absent or has no `layer: udf` entries, this check is **N/A** (not a FAIL) — record "no UDF layer".
PASS/FAIL with gaps and out-of-order or mis-routed UDFs listed.

### Update status

```yaml
artifacts:
  target_setup:
    validate: pass | fail
    validated_date: "{{TODAY}}"
```


## Post-Execution Hooks

After updating `status.md`, run these in sequence:

1. **Execution log** — Append one row to `.wire/releases/$ARGUMENTS/execution_log.md` following `specs/utils/execution_log.md`.

2. **Jira sync** — Follow `specs/utils/jira_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `target_setup` as artifact, `validate` as action.

3. **Document store** — Follow `specs/utils/docstore_sync.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as project_folder, `target_setup` as artifact_id, `Target Setup` as artifact_name, and the `file` value from `artifacts.target_setup` in status.md as file_path.

4. **Auto-commit** — Follow `specs/utils/commit.md`. Pass `$ARGUMENTS` as release_folder, `target_setup` as artifact, `validate` as action.

Execute the complete workflow as specified above.

## Execution Logging

After completing the workflow, append a log entry to the project's execution_log.md:

# Execution Log — Command and Skill Logging

## Purpose

After completing any generate, validate, or review workflow (or a project management command that changes state), append a single log entry to the project's execution log file. Skills also append an entry on activation, making the log a unified trace of all agent activity — both explicit commands and auto-activated skills.

## Log File Location

```
<DP_PROJECTS_PATH>/<project_folder>/execution_log.md
```

Where `<project_folder>` is the project directory passed as an argument (e.g., `20260222_acme_platform`).

## Format

If the file does not exist, create it with the header:

```markdown
# Execution Log

| Timestamp | Command | Result | Detail |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
```

Then append one row per execution:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | /wire:<command> | <result> | <detail> |
```

### Field Definitions

- **Timestamp**: Current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (24-hour, local time)
- **Command**: Either the `/wire:*` command invoked, or `skill` for a skill activation entry
- **Result / Skill name**: For commands, the outcome; for skills, the skill identifier. Use one of:
  - `complete` — generate command finished successfully
  - `pass` — validate command passed all checks
  - `fail` — validate command found failures
  - `approved` — review command: stakeholder approved
  - `changes_requested` — review command: stakeholder requested changes
  - `created` — `/wire:new` created a new project
  - `archived` — `/wire:archive` archived a project
  - `removed` — `/wire:remove` deleted a project
  - `activated` — a skill was auto-activated (used with `skill` in the Command column)
- **Detail**: A concise one-line summary of what happened. Include:
  - For generate: number of files created or key output filename
  - For validate: number of checks passed/failed
  - For review: reviewer name and brief feedback if changes requested
  - For new: project type and client name
  - For archive/remove: project name
  - For skill activations: brief description of what triggered the skill

## Skill Activation Entries

When a skill activates, it appends a row in the same format as commands, using `skill` in the Command column and the skill identifier in the Result column:

```markdown
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | skill | <skill-identifier> | activated | <brief trigger description> |
```

Skill identifiers:

| Skill | Identifier |
|-------|-----------|
| Engagement Context | `engagement-context` |
| Research Persistence | `research-persistence` |
| dbt Development | `dbt-development` |
| LookML Content Authoring | `lookml-authoring` |
| dbt Analytics QA | `dbt-analytics-qa` |
| dbt Migration | `dbt-migration` |
| dbt Troubleshooting | `dbt-troubleshooting` |
| dbt Semantic Layer | `dbt-semantic-layer` |
| dbt Unit Testing | `dbt-unit-testing` |
| dbt DAG | `dbt-dag` |
| Dagster | `dagster` |
| Fivetran | `fivetran` |
| Project Review | `project-review` |
| Looker Dashboard Mockup | `looker-dashboard-mockup` |

This makes skill activations visible in the same log that captures command invocations, enabling full activity tracing across both explicit commands and automatic skill triggers.

## Stale Status Check

Immediately after appending a **command** row (this does not apply to skill activation entries), perform a quick freshness check against the project's `status.md`. This is additive to the logging behavior above — it never blocks the calling command and never modifies `status.md`.

**Process**:
1. Derive `artifact_id` from the command just logged: strip the `/wire:` prefix and the trailing `-generate`, `-validate`, or `-review` suffix (e.g. `/wire:migration_inventory-generate` → `migration_inventory`). If the command doesn't map to a recognizable artifact (e.g. `/wire:new`, `/wire:status`, `/wire:archive`), skip this check entirely.
2. Read the artifact's own block in `status.md`: `artifacts.<artifact_id>`.
3. Check whether that artifact has already passed its review/approval gate — its `review` field (or equivalent approval field) shows `pass`, `approved`, or `complete`.
4. If the gate has passed, scan every field in the `artifacts.<artifact_id>` block for a value that is still the literal string `TBD`, or an empty list (`[]`) / `null` where the artifact's own template expects a populated value (i.e. the field is not legitimately optional).
5. For each stale field found, emit a one-line warning in the command's output:
   ```
   ⚠ status.md still shows `<field>: TBD` for `<artifact_id>` despite review: pass — status may be stale
   ```
   Emit one warning per stale field — do not suppress after the first.
6. If no stale fields are found, the review/approval gate has not yet passed, or `artifact_id` could not be derived: no output, proceed silently.

This check is self-contained within this utility, so every caller gets it automatically without any caller-side changes.

## Rules

1. **Append only** — never modify or delete existing log entries
2. **One row per command execution** — even if a command is re-run, add a new row (this creates the revision history)
3. **Always log after status.md is updated** — the log entry should reflect the final state
4. **Pipe characters in detail** — if the detail text contains `|`, replace with `—` to preserve table formatting
5. **Keep detail under 120 characters** — be concise
